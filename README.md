# Light-Stereo
This Project is a circuit based stereo. I replicated how my stereo works without the actual lyrics, but rather the beat of the song and the LEDs flash along with that beat. 
I also added in controls (push buttons and a potentiometer) to control the song choice, pause the song, and adjusting the volume.
Currently I only have for songs, but wish to add more and expand this project. 
Some future work includes creating an app to have better control instead of having push buttons. Also to create a PCB and solder the elements and use this anywhere around the house for enjoyment.
